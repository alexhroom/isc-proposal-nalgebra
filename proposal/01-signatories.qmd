# Signatories
<!--
This section provides the ISC with a view of the support received from
the community for a proposal. Acceptance isn't predicated on
popularity but community acceptance is important. Willingness to
accept outside input is also a good marker for project delivery.

An optional section would be for R-Core signatories where changes to R
are proposed.
